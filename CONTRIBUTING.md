## üìù Code Style Guidelines

### Python Code Style

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guidelines
- Use type hints for all function parameters and return values
- Keep functions focused and single-purpose
- Use descriptive variable and function names

### Example of Good Code Style

```python
from typing import List, Optional
from PyQt5.QtWidgets import QMainWindow

class ModernPdfReader(QMainWindow):
    """Modern PDF reader with advanced search capabilities."""
    
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        """Initialize the PDF reader application."""
        super().__init__()
        self._setup_ui()
        self._setup_connections()
    
    def search_text(self, query: str) -> List[SearchResult]:
        """
        Search for text in the current PDF document.
        
        Args:
            query: The text to search for
            
        Returns:
            List of search results with page numbers and positions
        """
        if not query.strip():
            return []
        
        results = []
        for page_num in range(self.engine.page_count):
            page_results = self.engine.search_in_page(page_num, query)
            if page_results:
                results.extend(page_results)
        
        return results
```

### UI Code Style

- Use descriptive names for UI elements
- Group related UI elements together
- Use consistent spacing and layout
- Follow the existing naming conventions

### Commit Message Format

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for commit messages:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

**Types:**
- `feat`: A new feature
- `fix`: A bug fix
- `docs`: Documentation only changes
- `style`: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code
- `refactor`: A code change that neither fixes a bug nor adds a feature
- `perf`: A code change that improves performance
- `test`: Adding missing tests or correcting existing tests
- `chore`: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools

**Examples:**
```
feat: add dark mode toggle
fix: resolve PDF rendering crash on Windows
docs: update installation instructions
style: format code according to PEP 8
```
